# 112-Term-Project
Project Description:
Blewns Tower Defense is closely based on the popular Ninja Kiwi browser (and later mobile) game Bloons Tower Defense. 
Players have the task of strategically placing towers (of varying strengths and firing styles) on the map so that they can most effectively pop the bloons that travel along the path. 
Each game starts with a designated amount of lives and coins. Towers cost costs, and when bloons are popped, the player gains coins. When bloons reach the end of the path, the player loses lives. 
Players are given the option of choosing between three levels of gameplay, as well as choosing whether to create their own map or use a randomly generated one.
